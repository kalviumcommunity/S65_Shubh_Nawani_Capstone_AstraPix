# AstraPix

AstraPix is an AI-powered image generation platform that enables users to create stunning visuals using state-of-the-art deep learning models. It offers both **text-to-image (txt2img)** and **image-to-image (img2img)** generation using fine-tuned **Replicate AI models**. Users can generate images by providing text prompts or modifying existing images with AI-driven enhancements. AstraPix combines advanced generative AI with a seamless user experience, supporting **manual authentication and OAuth, GitHub** while integrating a **token-based payment system via Razorpay** for premium image generation.

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend:**
- React.js
- TailwindCSS for a sleek and responsive design
- Axios for API requests

### **Backend:**
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose for user and image metadata storage
- JWT Authentication for secure user sessions
- Replicate API for AI image generation

### **Payments & Authentication:**
- Razorpay for handling token-based transactions
- GitHub OAuth for seamless authentication
- Manual authentication for standard login/signup

---

## How It Works

### **1. User Registration & Authentication**
- Users can sign up manually or log in using GitHub OAuth.
- Upon logging in, users receive free tokens to generate images.

### **2. Image Generation**
- Users enter a text prompt or upload an image for enhancement.
- The AI processes the request and generates the output image.
- The generated images are displayed in real time and stored in the user's history.

### **3. Token-Based Payment System**
- Users can purchase additional tokens via Razorpay to generate more images.
- Free users have limited access based on availability.

### **4. API Integration**
- Developers can access AstraPix API to integrate AI-powered image generation into their own applications.
